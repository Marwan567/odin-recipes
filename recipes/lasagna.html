<h4>Cooking steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>In a large saucepan, cook the ground beef or sausage over medium heat until browned. Drain the fat and set aside.</li>

    <li>Stir in 3 cups of tomato sauce, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer for 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, mix together 15 ounces of ricotta cheese, 2 eggs (if using), 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese, and a handful of chopped fresh basil leaves.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce mixture on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>Place a layer of oven-ready lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, breaking the noodles if necessary to fit.</li>
    <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Repeat the layering process, ending with a layer of tomato sauce on top.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle 8 ounces of shredded mozzarella cheese over the top.</li>
    <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbly.</li>
