<h4>Chicken Stir Fry Recipe</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Prepare the ingredients: Dice the chicken breast into 1-inch pieces, slice the bell peppers, onion, and carrots, and set aside. Mince the garlic and grate the ginger. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>

    <li>Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat and add 2 tablespoons of oil. Once hot, add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from the wok and set aside.</li>

    <li>In the same wok, add a bit more oil if needed. Stir in the garlic and ginger, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>

    <li>Add the bell peppers, onion, and carrots to the wok and stir fry until tender, about 3-4 minutes. Add the broccoli and continue to stir fry for another 2-3 minutes.</li>

    <li>Return the chicken to the wok and pour in the prepared sauce. Stir to evenly coat the ingredients with the sauce. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked and the sauce has thickened slightly.</li>

    <li>Serve the stir fry over cooked rice or noodles, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
